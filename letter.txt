Dearest Participant,

We are writing to you now on behalf of Rainn, as friends, comrades, and experts on the Magic Box you are the steward of during your journey of the Seven Days of Rainne. When we chose to dedicate our lives and work of the Path of Rainn, we both felt motivated to take the name of the day that most resonated with who we are as carriers of this knowledge as a kind of title and motivation to always be cognizant our intentions with the messages within.

What you see in front of you is not only a vessel now of light, it is also specifically spellcrafted to work with the accessible technology of your time. The Seven Fold Path of the Heart is an egalitarian practice, and it was vital to Rainn that each participant have equal access to the information. As followers of the Path of Rainn grow and learn from their own journeys, their insights, their knowledge might also join the lights within this box, as guided by what will be /most accessible/ to you.

May you be nourished by your jouney ,

Monday the Mage
and Wednesday the Technomancer
