Friday, dies Veneris
“the day of Venus.” 

Friday is the only weekday named for a female deity, 
the wife of Odin. 
Scholars argue if her name was Frigg;
others say it was Freya; 
and other still say Frig and Freya were two separate goddesses.
Whatever her name, she was the Roman goddess 
of love, beauty and fertility. 

That is why Frig was chosen to pair with the Roman deity Venus, 
who was likewise associated with love and sex, 
and was commemorated 
in the Latin name for Friday.
