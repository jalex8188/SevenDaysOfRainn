Monday, dies Lunae,
“the day of the moon.” 
a celestial body we’ve always remembered watching.

Monday is named for the moon, 
and comes from Old English “Mōnandæg,” 
named after Máni, 
the Norse personification of the moon 
(and Sól's brother). 
The Moon represents our sensitivity and feeling nature, 
It contains the essences of intuition, 
adaptivity 
and emotional attunement.
