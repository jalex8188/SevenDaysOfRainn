Saturday, dies Saturni, 
“the day of Saturn.” 

Saturday is named for Saturn. 
The English word comes from the Anglo-Saxon word 
“Sæturnesdæg,” or “Saturn’s day.” 

Saturn represents a fatherly figure that brings about 
rules, regulations, structure, obligation,
and some discipline,

creating meaning to our lives 
while reminding us of boundaries, 
commitments, and responsibilities.
