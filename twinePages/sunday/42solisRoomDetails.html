Sunday, dies Solis, 
“the day of the sun.”

Sunday is named for the sun. 
Sunday comes from Old English “Sunnandæg," 
which is derived from a Germanic interpretation of the Latin. 

Germanic and Norse mythology personify the sun 
as a goddess named Sunna or Sól. 

The essence of this day is 
to shine one’s light brightly, t
o take the lead, 
and to share one’s vitality.

Keywords for the Sun are creative, 
powerful and proud.
